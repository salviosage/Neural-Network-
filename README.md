## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name deepl python=3.6
	source activate dl
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name deepl python=3.6 
	activate dl
	```
	
2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the main `/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/salviosage/neural-network-.git
cd neural-network-
pip install .
```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `deepl` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name deepl --display-name "deepl"
```

4. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `deepl` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
